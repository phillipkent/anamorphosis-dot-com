<H2>Anamorph Me! (Java version)</H2>

<P><EM>Anamorph Me!</EM> is a free software application to carry out
anamorphic transformations on images. A new version is currently under 
development in Java, to be used as a set of plugins for the free 
image processing software, ImageJ (<A HREF="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" target="_blank">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</A>).</P>

<P>You can follow progress and download development versions of the Java software at the github repository: <A HREF="https://github.com/phillipkent/AnamorphMeIJ" target="_blank">https://github.com/phillipkent/AnamorphMeIJ</A> .</P> 

<P>The full source code is made available under a GNU GPL license.</P>

<H2>Anamorph Me! (version 0.2 for Windows)</H2>

<P>The original version of the software was published in 2001. It is old software, but still works well. </P>

<P><EM>Anamorph Me!</EM> is a free, small software application that can read
images in the most common formats (e.g. JPEG, BMP) and carry out a range 
of anamorphic transformations on them - including oblique, cylindical 
mirror and conical mirror. Please note that this software
runs in Microsoft Windows operating systems only (however you may have luck 
with a Windows emulator in MacOS or Linux - do let me know if you make 
that work).

<H2>Free software for image manipulation</H2>

<P>
<EM>Anamorph Me! (Windows version)</EM> offers only limited
manipulation functions for images. For standard operations such as
cropping, changing brightness, contrast and colours, and advanced
printing, you'll need an image manipulation program. Assuming that you
don't have, and don't want to buy, commercial software (such as
Photoshop), take a looking at the following free alternatives.
</P>

<H3>The GIMP</H3>

<P>The GNU Image Manipulation Program, or GIMP, is a fully-featured
image manipulation package (similar in scope to Photoshop) which is
freely-distributed and open source. The software runs in Windows, MacOS and
Linux.</P>

<P>A huge number of transformation algorithms are implemented in The
GIMP. Located in the Filters > Distorts menu is "Polar Coordinates", with
which you can do approximate mirror-cylindrical transformations, like
this software does, and also do inverse transformations from polar to
rectangular coordinates.</P>

<P>The GIMP home site is  <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org" target="_blank">www.gimp.org</A> .</P> 


<H3>ImageJ</H3>

<P>ImageJ is a free, open source image processing program that runs in Java. It will run on any computer that has a recent Java virtual machine ("Java runtime environment") installed.</P>

<P>ImageJ is widely used in the scientific community and is
particularly strong in scientific image processing, but there are a
wide range of built-in functions and functions contributed as plugins by the user community.</P>

<H3>IrfanView</H3>

<P>
IrfanView is an extremely good basic image viewer and editor for
Windows operating systems. Download from
<A HREF="http://www.irfanview.com" target="_blank">www.irfanview.com</A> .
