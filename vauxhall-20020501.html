<EM><STRONG>Location</STRONG>: Vauxhall, London
[<A HREF="http://uk2.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?GridE=530400&GridN=178000">neighbourhood street map</A>]
<BR>
<STRONG>Getting there</STRONG>: travel directly to the station via
Victoria Line underground, or British Rail from Waterloo;
<BR>
approximately 10 minutes walk from the
<A HREF="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain">Tate Britain</A> gallery, 
across Vauxhall Bridge</EM>.
</CENTER>

<P>
This ingenious design is painted onto the long curved vault beneath
the railway platforms. It consists of four different anamorphic
images, which need to be viewed from four different locations, marked
in the floor (though several of these markers have disappeared). The
main image, which I illustrate here, is a version of the classic "bent
stick" British Rail (BR) logo.

<P>
(Please excuse the dimness and fuzziness of these images, until I get some
better ones.)

<TD>This is the station entrance, on the Vauxhall Bridge side.<BR>

<TD>The weird actual shape of the painted image can
be appreciated from this "worm's eye view", drawn by William
Pye, which is displayed on an explanatory wall panel close to the
entrance barriers.</TD>
