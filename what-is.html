What is Anamorphosis? <br clear="LEFT">
<hr></h1>
<h2>An unconventional way of seeing</h2>
<p>
An anamorphosis is a deformed image that appears in its true shape
when viewed in some "unconventional" way. According to
<a
 href="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=anamorphosis">Webster's
1913 Dictionary</a>:</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote><em>A distorted or monstrous projection or representation
of an image on a
plane or curved surface, which, when viewed from a certain point, or
as reflected from a curved mirror or through a polyhedron, appears
regular and in proportion; a deformation of an image.
  </em></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
In one common form of anamorphosis---usually termed "oblique"--- the
unconventionality arises from the fact that the image must be viewed
from a position that is very far from the usual in-front and
straight-ahead position from which we normally expect images to be
looked at.
</p>
<p>
In another common form---sometimes termed "catoptric"---the image must
be seen reflected in a distorting mirror (typical shapes being
cylindrical, conical and pyramidal). The Hungarian artist <a
 target="_blank" href="http://www.utisz.net/">Istv&aacute;n
Orosz</a> has produced some beautiful examples of these.</p>
<p>
You can download from this web site a piece of software called <a
 href="software.html"><em>Anamorph Me!</em></a> which will allow you to
create your own oblique and catoptric anamorphoses.
</p>
<h2><em>The Ambassadors</em></h2>
<p>
A particularly well-known example of oblique anamorphosis is contained
in the painting known as <em>The Ambassadors</em> in the <a
 href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/">National Gallery</a> in
London.

In the lower half of this picture there is an oblong shape, which,
with a little inspection, you should be able to make out as the
distorted image of a human skull. (The symbolism of this has been much
debated; see, for example, the National Gallery book <em>Holbein's
Ambassadors-Making and Meaning</em>, 1998.)
</p>
<p>
The skull achieves its true shape if you view it from the right hand
side and very close to the plane of the painting. <em>To view it on a
computer screen, close your left eye, and put your right eye next to
the screen, about half way up the painting and about 5-10 cm. to the
right of it.</em> From this unconventional viewpoint, you will see
something like <a href="skull.html"><strong>[THIS]</strong></a>.

<h2>The uses of anamorphosis</h2>
<p>By far the most common use of "anamorphic" designs (of an
approximate
kind) is in road markings. The problem is that the markings
have to be viewed by road users from an "unconventional" position - at
a shallow angle - where the effect of <em>foreshortening</em> (that
is, the apparent shrinking of objects as they move further away) is to
significantly squash the vertical dimension. Here's a typical example:
</p>
<center>
<a href="arrow-distant.jpg" target="_blank"><img
 src="arrow-distant-small.jpg" alt="Road marking with an arrow">
</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="arrow-from-side.jpg" target="_blank"><img
 src="arrow-from-side-small.jpg" alt="Arrow viewed from side">
</a></center>
<p>Viewed from a distance, the height of the arrow looks the same as
the height of the word CAR below it. Viewed from the side, we can see
that the arrow is actually more than twice as high as the
word. (Conversely, of course, if the arrow were only the same height
as the word then it would appear half as high.) Note: Road markings
are usually based on stretching and are therefore not
strictly-speaking anamorphic - oblique anamorphosis is <em>not</em> a
simple (linear) stretch.

<P>The idea of anamorphosis is used in the creation of wide-screen
movies xxx SOME NAMES OF FORMATS XXX. Special wide-angle (7 x 4 ???)
cameras are used during the shooting ... these wide images are passed
through a "squeezing" lens onto standard (3 x 4???) film stock, which
is then distributed to cinemas. Inside the cinema projector, another
lens expands the squeezed images, restoring them to thier full width

<p>In past centuries, anamorphic designs were used as "secret images",
sometimes to hide erotic drawings, sometimes images of a
politically-sensitive nature, such as this portrait of the British
King Charles the First which circulated amongst Royalist sympathisers
after the King's execution in 1649:

</font></center>
<h2>What has <em>trompe l'oeil</em> got to do with it?</h2>
<p>Oblique anamorphosis is closely related to an artistic technique
called <em>trompe l'oeil</em> (French for "deceiving the eye",
pronounced "tromp loy"). Both use perspective constructions to create
a "trick" image, but the difference lies in the nature of the
trick. For an anamorphosis, the viewer is presented with something
that does not make sense when viewed conventionally, and so he or she
must seek out the unconventional viewpoint from which the trick is
resolved. For trompe l'oeil, the viewer, standing in one particular
(and usually conventional) place, is tricked into seeing an invented
image as if it were reality. One of the most stunning examples of the
technique is the fresco painting on the ceiling of the Church of Saint
Ignazio in Rome, created by Andrea Pozzo during 1691-1694. A
semi-circular roof is transformed into a fantastic picture of the
heavens, in which Saint Ignatius ascends into paradise:
</p>

<a href="Pozzo-wrong-view.jpg" target="_blank"><img
 src="Pozzo-wrong-view-small.jpg" alt="Pozzo fresco, wrongly viewed"
 align="center">
</a></center>
<p>
Trompe l'oeil designs only "trick" from their intended viewing
point. Seen away from that point (as in the right-hand picture) the
imaginary architecture distorts alarmingly. Pozzo himself said: "Since
Perspective is but a Counterfeiting of the Truth, the Painter is not
obliged to make it appear real when seen from <em>Any</em> part, but
from <em>One</em> determinate Point only." (Quoted in M. H. Pirenne,
<em>Optics, Painting and Photography</em>, p. 90) In fact,
Pozzo's skill in making the painted surface undetectable results in
making the distortions more extreme - if the surface <em>could</em> be
seen, the brain would be able to compensate for viewing away from the
perspective viewpoint (see Michael Kubovy, <em>The Psychology of
Perspective and Renaissance Art</em>, 1986).
</p>
<p>
By playing with the conventions
of seeing, both trompe l'oeil and anamorphosis should remind us that
what you see has a great deal to do with where you are looking from.
</p>
<h2>What you see is what you get?</h2>
<p>We like to think that seeing is some kind of "direct" perception of
reality. But in fact our brains are constantly interpreting and
giving structure to the raw visual input from our eyes. Take the
everyday situations of seeing an open door, or a building as we walk
along the street. Immediately, we give these objects a stable,
rectangular
form, which amazingly does not appear to change as we move relative to
the object, but is that form actually there?...
</p>
<center>

 border="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="Building-in-perspective.jpg" alt="Photo of a building"
 align="center" border="1"></center>
<p>There are some subtle details here (to do with binocular
vision, and also that a camera does not "see" like the human eye), but
fundamentally the brain is making a choice,
that there <em>is</em> a rectangular form which <em>appears</em>
distorted because parts
of it are further away than other parts. A non-rectangular shape
<em>could</em> look the same, but we don't expect to see such shapes.
The "<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_room">Ames
Room</a>" illusion brilliantly exposes the
kind of expectations that we automatically apply to what we see.
</p>
<blockquote>"We prefer an ordered world, regular patterns, familiar
forms,
and when flaws or distortions occur, provided they are not too gross,
our
mind's eye tidies them up. We see what we want or expect to see ..."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"... We never see the whole of any solid object at any given moment;
even
to see the whole surface of so simple an object as a sphere, six
successive viewpoints are needed ... But we accept at a single glance
that it is a sphere: we complete it on the assumption that it is a
consistent shape, and the simplest possible one. In fact it might be
any one of countless forms that are only partly spherical. There is a
fountain court at Granada where visitors are told the story of a
Moorish Caliph about to appoint a Grand Vizier. He invited the
candidates to identify an object lying or floating in shallow
water. All but one promptly said it to be an orange. One picked it
up, and identified it as half an orange; he got the job." (Lawrence
Wright, <em>Perspective in Perspective</em>, pages 27, 24).
